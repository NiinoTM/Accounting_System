# FinTrack Project README

## Overview
FinTrack is a financial tracking application designed to manage and monitor various financial aspects such as accounts, transactions, and reporting. This application uses a SQLite database for data storage and PySide6 for the graphical user interface.

## Project Structure
- `create_database.py`: Initializes the SQLite database and creates necessary tables.
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application that sets up the main window and starts the application.
- `main_window.py`: Defines the Main Window UI and menu structure.
- `crud.py`: Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for database interactions.
- `accounting_periods_actions.py`: Manages actions related to accounting periods.
- `accounts_actions.py`: Manages actions related to accounts.
- `categories_actions.py`: Manages actions related to categories.
- `setup_actions.py`: Initializes and manages setup menu actions.

    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Checklist of Tasks to Complete

### Database Setup
- [ ] **Finalize Database Schema**
  - Review and ensure all tables in `create_database.py` are necessary and correctly structured.
  - Ensure foreign key relationships are properly established.

- [ ] **Add Seed Data**
  - Consider adding initial seed data for other tables (e.g., `categories`, `accounts`) after database creation.

### User Interface
- [ ] **Enhance Main Window**
  - Implement additional UI components for the dashboard to display financial summaries.
  
- [ ] **Complete Menu Actions**
  - Implement menu actions for:
    - Transactions (add, view, edit, delete)
    - Reports (generate various financial reports)
    - Assets (track and manage fixed assets)

### CRUD Functionality
- [ ] **Implement CRUD for All Entities**
  - Implement CRUD operations for:
    - Accounting periods
    - Accounts
    - Categories
    - Debt and Credit records
    - Journal entries
    - Payment history
    - Assets
  - Ensure each CRUD action is properly connected to UI elements (e.g., buttons in menus).

- [ ] **Validation and Error Handling**
  - Add input validation for all CRUD operations to ensure data integrity.
  - Implement error handling to manage exceptions during database operations.

### Additional Features
- [ ] **Search and Filter Functionality**
  - Implement search and filter capabilities in the UI for easy data retrieval.

- [ ] **Reporting Module**
  - Design and implement a reporting module to generate financial reports based on the data (e.g., balance sheet, income statement).

- [ ] **User Authentication**
  - Consider adding user authentication for secure access to the application.

### Testing
- [ ] **Write Unit Tests**
  - Write unit tests for `crud.py` to ensure all CRUD operations function correctly.

- [ ] **UI Testing**
  - Conduct UI testing to ensure the application behaves as expected when interacting with the GUI.

### Documentation
- [ ] **Update README**
  - Include detailed usage instructions, examples, and descriptions of features in the README.

- [ ] **Code Documentation**
  - Document each module and function with appropriate docstrings and comments.

### Deployment
- [ ] **Prepare for Deployment**
  - Create a standalone executable if necessary (e.g., using PyInstaller or similar tools).
  - Write installation instructions for users.

### Final Review
- [ ] **Code Review**
  - Review the entire codebase for best practices, code quality, and potential refactoring opportunities.

- [ ] **User Feedback**
  - Plan for user feedback and potential improvements based on user interactions with the application.
