Fixed Assets come from somewhere

Fixed Asset
    -    Cash

Fixed Asset
    -    Capital

Fixed Asset
    -   Account1
    -   Account2
    -   Account3

then you will have 3 options,
purchased asset - buy using only one account, buy using multiple accounts that will have a button to add one more account and value. (note that the value of the asset should equal the sum of all accounts, eg cash, bank etc.)
import existing fixed asset (should have no value in account table)
